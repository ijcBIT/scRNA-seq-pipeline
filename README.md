# scRNA-seq-pipeline

## Background:  
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the ability to investigate gene expression dynamics at the cellular level, suggesting insights into cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms that were previously inaccessible with bulk sequencing which is a straight-forward method for comparing the averages of cellular expression. However, analyzing scRNA-seq data presents challenges such as noise, batch effects, and high dimensionality, highlighting the need to create robust preprocessing pipelines. 


## Purpose:  
This pipeline aims to provide a standardized framework for preprocessing scRNA-seq data, facilitating the extraction of biologically meaningful insights. By improving data quality and reducing noise, the pipeline aims to enhance the interpretability of scRNA-seq results and enable researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity and regulatory networks. Practically, the pipeline will be implemented to analyze in-house data produced be the single cell core facility 


## Methods:  
In this project, we developed a preprocessing pipeline for scRNA-seq data analysis using tools such as Cell Ranger and Seurat.  
We initiate the pipeline by processing raw sequencing data obtained from high-throughput sequencing platforms such as 10x Genomics Chromium with the Cell Ranger software, designed by 10x Genomics .Cell Ranger handles raw data processing, conducts quality control checks, and generates feature-barcode matrices. These matrices represent gene expression counts for individual cells, facilitating downstream analyses.  
Secondly we employ Seurat, an R package designed explicitly for preprocessing, normalization, and quality control (QC) in scRNA-seq analysis. Utilizing Seurat within the R environment, we implemented additional processing steps to enhance data quality and reliability. This includes quality control measures to filter out low-quality cells, normalizing gene expression levels across cells to mitigate technical biases and performing dimensionality reduction techniques to simplify the dataset while preserving its biological structure.  
Moreover, Seurat's functionality extends to batch correction algorithms, which we integrated into our pipeline to address batch effects and enhance the reliability of downstream analyses. By leveraging Seurat's comprehensive set of functions, we aimed to create a robust preprocessing framework that ensures the integrity of scRNA-seq data and facilitates the extraction of biologically meaningful insights.  

  
## Input/Output:  
The pipeline takes raw scRNA-seq read data as input, usually as FASTQ files in a compressed or uncompressed (.gz) format. The output includes preprocessed data ready for downstream analyses, such as aligned reads in BAM format and quality-controlled, normalized, and batch-corrected gene expression matrices. These processed data are used for further investigations into cell type identification, differential gene expression analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis, thereby helping to understand complex biological systems at the single-cell level.
