# Development and implementation of an automated pipeline for Immunoprofiling Gene Expression 5â€™ Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has greatly improved the study of gene expression at the cellular level, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms that bulk sequencing cannot offer. However, scRNA-seq data analysis is challenging due to noise, batch effects, and high dimensionality, necessitating robust preprocessing pipelines. This project aims to implement a standardized preprocessing pipeline for scRNA-seq data to enhance data quality and interpretability through automization and integration with the experimental workflow of single-cell RNA sequencing. We employ established tools, Cell Ranger and Seurat, for raw data processing, quality control, normalization, and dimensionality reduction. Our pipeline addresses batch effects and ensures the integrity of scRNA-seq data, facilitating downstream analyses such as cell type identification and differential gene expression. Integration with Singularity container technology ensures reproducibility and smooth execution across different computational platforms. The output of the pipeline includes quality-controlled, normalized, and batch-corrected gene expression matrices, detailed analysis reports in HTML and PDF formats, and an interactive Shiny app for dynamic data exploration. These comprehensive outputs enable a deeper understanding of complex biological systems at the single-cell level.
